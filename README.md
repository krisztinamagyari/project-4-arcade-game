## Instructions

#### Aim of the game
In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.

#### How to play the game
The player can move left, right, up and down with the arrow keys. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once the player reaches the water the game is won. Once the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. The player has three lives, indicated by red hearts in the lower part of the play area. After three collissions with the enemy, all lives are lost, and the game is over.
